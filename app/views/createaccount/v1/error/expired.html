      <h1>Your invite has expired</h1>  


            <p>This could be because:
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>you received it more than 7 days ago</li>
            <li>you have already accepted the invite</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>If you havenâ€™t already accepted the invite, you will need to ask your GP to send a new one. If they send you a new one, delete the previous email and respond to the invite from the new email.
      </p>

      <p>If you have already accepted the invite, you can go directly to the website or app you were trying to access and log in with your NHS login.
